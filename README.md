<img align="left" height="200" src="DISC.png" />At the [Diversity and Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Unconference](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/diversity-inclusion/disc-unconference-2017/), our group focused on ways to start and maintain conversations about diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our product for the two-day unconference was this quick start guide and a set of D&I Big Talk cards<sup>[[13](#r-13)]</sup>.

The Conversation Quick Start Kit was built from a variety of online resources, as well as input from other attendees at the unconference. There were three main questions framing the discussion:
  1. How can I have a conversation with a coworker/friend about offensive comments without making them defensive?
  1. When is the right time to have that conversation and how do I create a safe space for them to be willing to see my perspective?
  1. After the starting conversation, how do I ensure that it progresses organically?

The D&I Big Talk cards were inspired by Kalina Silverman’s _[Make Big Talk Experiment](http://www.makebigtalk.com/)_. They are organized into three different levels, with the intention of being used over a series of small group or one-on-one meetings, progressing from level 1 to level 3. If you have suggestions for additional questions, please submit them [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4mDz0Ovfs2Bb3Hrd2VJPUjLGpmJypKngTQTjcrS-rgDqhlQ/viewform).

Overall the DISC Unconference provided a fantastic venue for connecting with others who are also actively working to promote diversity and inclusion in the scientific computing community.
